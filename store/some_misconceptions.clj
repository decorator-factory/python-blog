  ((h 2)
    "Q1. Is Python " (it "intepreted") " or " (it "compiled") "?")
  (p "Can you compile Python to machine code? "
    "Yes, you can use Nuitka for that. Does it have a JIT compiler? "
    "Yes, it's called PyPy.")
  (p "The most widely used and supported Python implementation is "
    (it "CPython") ". CPython executes a program by first compiling it "
    "into bytecode and then executing the bytecode. This is the model used "
    "in other languages, like JavaScript, Lua, Java, C#.")
  (p "Some languages are usually compiled all the way to machine code, like "
    "C, C++, Rust, Go, Haskell. Some languages can be compiled to "
    "machine code but can also be ran as bytecode, for example, "
    "Haskell can also target the JVM.")
  (p (it "Compiled") " and " (it "interpreted") " are poorly defined "
    "and inconsistently applied (i.e. Java is 'compiled' while Python "
    "is 'interpreted', even though they both compile to bytecode). "
    "Besides, a single language can have multiple implementations that "
    "have different execution models. It's much more useful to elaborate "
    "and discuss"
    (list-unordered
      "how execution speed differs between langauges"
      "how a particular implementation of a language works"
      "how memory models differ between languages and implementation"
      "how type systems differ between languages"))
  (horizontal-rule)
  (p "Some resources get it wrong even worse. For example, "
    (a "https://www.interviewbit.com/python-interview-questions/" "this website")
    " claims that: " (it "An Interpreted language executes its statements line by line. "
    "Languages such as Python, Javascript, R, PHP and Ruby are prime examples of "
    "Interpreted languages. Programs written in an interpreted language runs directly "
    "from the source code, with no intermediary compilation step."))

  ((h 2)
    "Q2. Are tuples hashable?")
  (p "Some of them are. Some of them aren't.")
  (p "A tuple is hashable if all of its elements are hashable. "
     "For example, " (mono "hash((1, 2, 3))") " will succeed, while "
     (mono "hash(([1, 2], [3, 4]))") " will raise an exception.")

  (horizontal-rule)
  ((h 2)
    "Q3. How do you check if a stirng only contains digits "
    "(for example, if you want to convert a string into an integer)?")
  (p (mono "str.isdigit") " might seem an obvious choice, but there's "
    "a catch: it will also accept special digit characters like Â². The "
    "right method to use here is " (mono "str.isdecimal"))

  (horizontal-rule)
  ((h 2)
    "Q4. What operations do " (mono "<, >, <=, >=") " stand for?")
  (p "Those operations help determine ordering: whether one element "
    "comes before or after another. Unlike some languages, like Python 2 and "
    "JavaScript, comparing two uncomparable values (for example, a number "
    "and a string) will raise an exception. Strings, lists, and tuples "
    "are compared lexicographically.")
  (p "There is also an unexpected usage of those operators in the standard "
    "library: when used on sets, they act as "
    (e "sub") ", " (e "sup") ", " (e "sube") ", " (e "supe") ".")

  (horizontal-rule)
  ((h 2)
    "Q5. What data types does Python support?")
  (p "All of them!")
  (p "Seriously, though, this is a vague question. You probably cannot "
    "hold all the built-in data types in your head because there are just "
    "so many of them. First, there are obvious types like integerss, strings, "
    "lists, dicts, and so on. Then there are standard library types that are not "
    "built-in: stuff from " (mono "collections") ", " (mono "datetime") " etc. ")
  (p "Then there are datatypes which hide in plain sight: many people don't realize "
    "they are separate data types. For example, " (mono "range") " is not a function, "
    "it's a class " (--) " and calling it create a " (mono "range") " object, "
    "which is iterable, but not an iterator. " (mono "map") ", " (mono "filter")
    ", " (mono "itertools.groupby") ", " (mono "int/list/str/...") " are all "
    "classes as well.")
  (p "And don't forget that in Python, " (it "class") " is the same thing "
    "as " (it "type") ", so every time you define a class you create "
    "a new data type. So statements like " (it "'There are N data types"
    " in Python'") " are misleading. There can be as many types in Python as "
    "you want")
